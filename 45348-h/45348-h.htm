<h2>A FEW GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this volume is to present to the
public a number of attractive receipts in a form so
clear and concise as to render their execution practicable
and comparatively easy. This is a need
which we believe has long been felt; those books of
value on the subject of cookery hitherto published
generally having been written in French, and those
which have appeared in English, while perhaps containing
something of merit, usually so abound in the
use of technical terms as to harass and puzzle the
inexperienced. The general directions also are usually
of such vague and incomprehensible a character
as to render their meaning quite unintelligible to the
reader. In view of these difficulties, we have endeavored
to avoid those terms not generally understood,
and to condense each receipt as much
as possible, compatible with a clear and thorough
understanding of the subject. We have also studied
simplicity of language, so that our book may come
within the comprehension of all classes, and that
which we consider of importance, to cooks themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
We believe that we will not be met with indignant
protest in venturing to assert that cooking
as an art is greatly neglected in America, this fact
being only too frequently and universally deplored.
The wealthy who may afford a <i>chef</i>, or very experienced
cook, are vastly in the minority of those who
suffer from the incapability of cooks, and also from
the lack of knowledge on their own part, leading to
the neglect of one of the most important factors
of comfortable living. We think, however, that the
number of people of moderate income, desiring to
live well, and yet within their means, is very large;
and it is to these, as well as to the more affluent, that
we hope this book may be of use, for, while economy
is not its <i>sole</i> object, the variety of receipts for palatable
dishes which may be prepared at small cost is
very large. On the other hand, of course, there
are a great number of dishes which are obviously
expensive; but these may be distinguished at a
glance.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would remark that, as we know
the furnishings of American kitchens to be very
meager, we have forborne the mention of particular
utensils for the preparation of certain dishes. There
are, however, a few articles which are indispensable
if the best results are expected&mdash;viz., a Dutch oven,
for roasting meats, poultry, and game, <i>before</i> the fire,
and <i>not</i> in the oven of the range, which bakes instead
of roasting, and so dries up the juices of the
meats.</p>

<p>A mortar and pestle will also be required when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"pounding" is mentioned, as for chicken, meats, almonds,
etc.</p>

<p>A fine sieve is necessary for the straining of
sauces; and two flannel bags, kept scrupulously
clean, one for the purpose of straining soups and
the other for straining jellies.</p>


<h3>SOUPS AND SAUCES.</h3>

<p>It must be constantly borne in mind that soups
must be always allowed to simmer gently, and <i>never</i>
to boil fast, except where express directions are
given to that effect. Always be particular to remove
every particle of scum whenever it rises. When
stock is put away on ice to become cold for the
next day's use, remove the fat on the top with a
spoon, wipe over the top of the jelly with a cloth
dipped in hot water, and then, with a dry cloth,
wipe the jelly dry. It, however, seems to us a good
plan to keep the stock-pot always filled, the stock
simmering on the fire, so as to be at hand when
needed for the preparation of different soups and
sauces. In fact, this seems almost indispensable
where a variety of dishes is required. The same
rule in regard to slow boiling also applies to sauces.</p>


<h3>BROILING.</h3>

<p>Be careful to always grease the bars of your gridiron
before laying on it the object to be broiled.
It is better to broil on a gridiron <i>before</i> the fire than
on one which is placed on top of the range. Season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with salt and pepper while broiling, and not after the
object is taken from the fire.</p>


<h3>FRYING.</h3>

<p>Be careful that your frying-pan is very clean, as
anything adhering to the bottom of the pan is apt
to burn, and therefore spoil the object to be fried.
To fry well, the fat should always be very hot, as
its success depends entirely on this. To judge of
the proper temperature of the fat, when it becomes
quite still, dip the prongs of a fork in cold water,
and allow a few drops to fall into the fat, which,
if it crackles, is sufficiently hot. Or, drop a small
piece of bread into the fat, and if it fries instantly
a light brown, the desired result is reached. Dripping
and butter should be clarified before using, the
former in the following manner: Put the dripping
in a saucepan, on the fire, and when boiling pour it
into a bowl, into which you have previously put
half a pint of cold water. When cold, with a knife
cut around the edge and remove the cake of dripping.
Scrape off all the sediment adhering to the
bottom of the cake, which wipe dry with a clean
cloth.</p>

<p>Many persons prefer lard rather than dripping
for frying.</p>

<p>Butter is clarified in the following manner: Put
some butter in a saucepan on the fire, and when
boiling remove the scum from the top, and pour the
clear butter gently into the pan which is required
for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite indispensable to good cooking that
every dish requiring to be served hot should never
be allowed to wait in the kitchen, but should be
served with the greatest promptitude possible, as a
dish prepared with every imaginable care will be
sure to fail of its effect if served lukewarm or cold.
The first quality in a cook, therefore, should be
punctuality, which should be encouraged and appreciated
by the guests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small><i>SOUPS.</i></small></h2>


<p><a id="Art_1">1.</a> <b>Consommé, or Stock.</b> Put in a stock-pot
a roast fowl (or the carcass and remains of a
fowl), a knuckle of veal, three pounds of beef, and
three quarts of water. When the scum begins to
rise, skim carefully until it quite ceases to appear.
Then add a carrot, a turnip, an onion, a leek, two
cloves, a little celery, and a little salt. Simmer very
gently four hours. Remove every particle of grease,
and strain through a flannel kept for the purpose.
This soup is the foundation of most soups and
sauces. To clarify: when necessary that the soup
should be very clear, clarify it in the following manner:
Put in a saucepan a pound of chopped raw
beef (off the round is preferable), which mix with an
egg and two glasses of water, and pour into your consommé.
Simmer very gently for an hour, and strain.</p>

<p><a id="Art_2">2</a>. <b>Bouillon, or Beef Broth.</b> Put into a stock-pot
three pounds of a shin of beef, one pound of
a knuckle of veal, and three quarts of water, and
simmer gently. As soon as the scum begins to
rise, skim carefully until it quite ceases to appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Then add salt, two carrots, the same of onions, leeks,
turnips, and a little celery. Simmer gently four
hours, strain, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_3">3</a>. <b>Bouillon Maigre.</b> Take six medium-sized
carrots, as many turnips, a bunch of celery, and two
leeks. Boil them in water for a few moments, drain,
put them in cold water for a moment, after which
put them into three quarts of water, adding two
cloves, and boil gently three hours. Add a little
salt, put through a sieve, heat again on the fire, and
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_4">4</a>. <b>Bouillon Maigre of Fish.</b> Put into three
quarts of water two pounds of black bass, two pounds
of pike, and one pound of eels. Add to these two
onions, two carrots, one head of celery, two cloves,
and a little salt. Simmer gently for two hours, and
strain. This bouillon is used as a foundation for all
soups and sauces composed of fish.</p>

<p><a id="Art_5">5</a>. <b>Pot-au-Feu.</b> Put into a saucepan three
quarts of water, two pounds of beef cut in slices, a
fowl partially roasted, a knuckle of veal, and a little
salt. Simmer gently, and as soon as boiling begins,
skim carefully. Add two carrots, two turnips,
two leeks, a few branches of celery, an onion stuck
with two cloves, and boil four hours. Drain your
vegetables carefully, remove every particle of grease
from your soup, strain, pour it over your vegetables,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_6">6</a>. <b>Soup à la Julienne</b> (Vegetable Soup). Divide
two medium-sized carrots in two, then cut into
very thin slices of about an inch long; take the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
quantity of turnips, leeks, onions, and a few pieces
of celery, all cut into thin slices, and put them into
a saucepan, with a piece of good butter, on a gentle
fire, stir softly until the vegetables begin to color
slightly, add three pints of consommé (or stock,
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and boil gently one hour. Ten minutes
before serving put in three or four leaves of lettuce,
the same of sorrel, and a little chervil chopped up,
boil a little longer, adding a pinch of sugar, and a
tablespoonful of green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_7">7</a>. <b>Soup à la Printanière.</b> This soup is made
exactly as the foregoing, except with the addition of
asparagus-tops to the other vegetables, which, instead
of being in slices, are cut out in fancy shapes with a
vegetable-cutter, which may be procured at any hardware-shop.</p>

<p><a id="Art_8">8</a>. <b>Soup à la Brunoise.</b> Cut into square
pieces, as small as possible, a carrot, a turnip, an
onion, a leek, and a few pieces of celery. Stew
gently in a saucepan with a little butter, stir softly
until beginning to color lightly, drain, and put into
three pints of consommé (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), which boil
gently for an hour, skim off the grease carefully,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_9">9</a>. <b>Soup à la Paysanne.</b> Take two tablespoonfuls
of white beans, the same of green peas.
Cut in slices a carrot, a little celery, a turnip, a leek,
a cucumber, and a few string-beans; add a dozen
little onions and a pinch of sugar. Put these into
three pints of consommé (or stock), which boil
gently an hour. Before serving you may add a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
pieces of bread cut in small squares and fried in
butter.</p>

<p><a id="Art_10">10</a>. <b>Soup with (farcied) Lettuce.</b> Boil ten
moderate-sized lettuce, then dip them in cold water,
drain and press the water from them. Separate
them in two, season with a little pepper and salt,
then lay a tablespoonful of farce on the half of one
lettuce, and cover with the other half. Wrap up
each lettuce with a piece of <i>very thin</i> larding pork,
place them carefully in a saucepan containing half
a pint of consommé (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and a few
branches of parsley, inclosing a clove of garlic, three
pepper-corns, three cloves, and tie all together. After
boiling gently an hour, drain the lettuce, remove
the larding pork, the parsley, and its seasoning.
Have boiling three pints of consommé (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), into
which place your lettuce, and serve. It would be
well to tie the larding pork around the lettuce, so
that the farce should not escape.</p>

<p><a id="Art_11">11</a>. <b>Farce.</b> Place in a saucepan four ounces
of very fresh bread-crumbs and a cup of consommé
(or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>). Simmer gently for ten minutes,
at the end of which time stir constantly with a wooden
spoon, and boil for ten minutes longer, so as to
form a soft paste. This done, put it on a plate to cool.
Take four ounces of the breast of a chicken, from
which remove the skin and sinews, and pound extremely
fine. Add to this your bread-crumbs, in
quantity about three quarters as much as you have
of chicken, and pound together until well mixed;
season with a little salt and white pepper, a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
nutmeg, and a piece of butter. Then pound
again, adding by degrees two eggs, until you have
obtained a fine, smooth paste. This mixture is
used for all farces of chicken. Veal, fish, and game
are treated in the same manner. Quenelles are also
made of this mixture, by forming it into small balls,
and poaching them in boiling water for two minutes.</p>

<p><a id="Art_12">12</a>. <b>Sorrel Soup</b> (clear). Wash a good handful
of sorrel, which chop up together with a lettuce and
a teaspoonful of chopped chervil, and put in a saucepan
with half an ounce of butter. When beginning
to color lightly, add three pints of consommé (or
stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and boil gently twenty minutes. Add
a pinch of sugar, and skim the grease carefully from
your soup. Serve with small squares of bread fried
in butter a light brown.</p>

<p><a id="Art_13">13</a>. <b>Cucumber Soup with Green Peas.</b> Cut
two cucumbers in small pieces, and, adding a pinch
of sugar, cook in a little stock for about half an
hour, then add a pint of green peas, previously
boiled, and serve in three pints of consommé (or
stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Art_14">14</a>. <b>Soup à la Pluche de Cerfeuil</b> (Chervil
Soup). Fry in butter pieces of bread cut in small
squares, after which drain them. Pick and clean a
handful of chervil, and, taking only the ends of the
leaves, serve, together with bread, in three pints of
consommé.</p>

<p><a id="Art_15">15</a>. <b>Potage aux Pointes d'Asperges</b> (Asparagus
Soup). Take from two bunches of asparagus
only the small green ends, wash them, and then put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them in a saucepan in boiling water with a little salt,
and a very little soda, so as to make them very green.
Then, having thoroughly boiled them, put them for
a moment in cold water, drain, and serve them in
three pints of consommé (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and add small
squares of bread fried in butter.</p>

<p><a id="Art_16">16</a>. <b>Croûtes au Pot.</b> Cut a carrot, a turnip, and
a few pieces of celery in small pieces, blanch them
in hot water, drain them, and boil with three pints
of consommé (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>); take four French
rolls, which divide in two, taking out all the soft part,
and butter the inside. Put them in the oven, and,
as soon as they become browned, serve them in your
consommé, with the addition of a tablespoonful of
green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_17">17</a>. <b>Consommé with Poached Eggs.</b> Put
in a saucepan with some boiling water a tablespoonful
of vinegar and a pinch of salt, in which poach
eight eggs. Then take them out and put them in
cold water, so as to pare the whites perfectly round,
lay them again in hot water for a moment, and serve
in three pints consommé (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Art_18">18</a>. <b>Consommé Royal.</b> Break into a bowl two
eggs, with which mix thoroughly half a glass of milk.
Butter a little saucepan, into which strain your eggs
and milk. Then put your saucepan into a flat pan,
which you have half filled with boiling water, and
place in a moderate oven for about thirty minutes.
Take it out to cool, and when cold, cut in little
squares, and serve in three pints of consommé (see
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>). If desired, add a handful of green peas, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
few thin slices of carrots, a few string-beans cut in
diamond-shapes, or a few green ends of asparagus,
all previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_19">19</a>. <b>Soup à la Princesse.</b> Boil a fowl in a
little stock for two hours. Take it out and let it become
cold. Boil two tablespoonfuls of barley, which
afterward put in cold water for a moment. Also
boil about a handful of green peas. Cut the chicken
into small pieces, after having carefully removed all
skin, and put into three pints of consommé (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>
), together with the barley and peas, boil for five
minutes and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_20">20</a>. <b>Beef Soup.</b> Boil two ounces of barley with
a little salt for ten minutes, then put in cold water
for a moment, cut into small squares four ounces
of cold beef, which, with the barley, and about an
eighth of a can of tomatoes, boil for ten minutes
in three pints of consommé (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_21">21</a>. <b>Vermicelli Soup.</b> Take four ounces of
vermicelli, which boil in hot water for twenty minutes,
then put in cold water for a moment and drain.
Put three pints of consommé (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) in a saucepan,
and, as soon as it begins to boil, pour in the vermicelli;
boil for ten minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_22">22</a>. <b>Vermicelli Soup with Green Peas.</b> Prepare
as the foregoing, and just before serving add
eight tablespoonfuls of green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_23">23</a>. <b>Farina Soup.</b> Add to three pints of boiling
consommé (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) two ounces of farina
by degrees, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so as to prevent thickening into lumps, and, after
boiling gently twenty minutes, serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_24">24</a>. <b>Arrowroot Soup.</b> Put in a saucepan four
teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, which moisten with a little
cold stock, so as to form a smooth paste; then add
to it three pints of hot stock, taking care to stir with
a spoon from time to time, so as not to stick to the
saucepan, and, after boiling gently twenty minutes,
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_25">25</a>. <b>Soup with Italian Paste.</b> Take four
ounces of Italian paste and blanch in boiling water
with a little salt for twenty minutes. Drain, and
put in three pints of consommé (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), boil for
ten minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_26">26</a>. <b>Sago Soup.</b> Take two ounces of sago,
which boil gently in three pints of consommé (see
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) for thirty minutes, taking care to stir constantly
with a spoon; serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_27">27</a>. <b>Tapioca Soup.</b> Put in three pints of
consommé (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) four ounces of tapioca, which
stir constantly; boil for forty minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_28">28</a>. <b>Potage de Nouilles</b> (Noodle Soup). Take
four ounces of flour, very little salt, and two yolks
of eggs, with which make a tolerably firm paste.
Roll it out very thin, taking care to sprinkle some
flour on the table, so that the paste does not stick.
Fold it in two; cut it in very thin slices of about an
inch long, and blanch them in boiling water ten minutes;
after which put in cold water for a moment,
drain, and serve in three pints of boiling consommé
(see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Art_29">29</a>. <b>Soup with Rice.</b> Take four ounces of rice,
which wash well, then boil for ten minutes, and put
in cold water for a moment. Boil the rice in three
pints of consommé (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) for forty minutes;
skim and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_30">30</a>. <b>Rice Soup à la Créole.</b> Take six ounces
of rice, which prepare as the foregoing, and ten minutes
before serving add about an eighth of a can of
tomatoes, and a little cayenne pepper; boil for a
moment, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_31">31</a>. <b>Chicken Consommé.</b> Take a chicken,
cut it in pieces and put in a saucepan with two
quarts of water, and let it simmer gently until the
scum begins to rise, skim until every particle is removed;
then add salt, a carrot, an onion, a turnip,
and a little celery. Boil gently for two hours, strain,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_32">32</a>. <b>Chicken Giblet.</b> Cut a chicken, an onion,
and a little ham, each in small pieces. Put all together,
in a saucepan, on the fire, and add half an
ounce of butter. When beginning to color slightly,
add three points of consommé (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and a
pinch of rice; and, after boiling three quarters of
an hour, add two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes, boil
five minutes longer, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_33">33</a>. <b>Chicken Gumbo.</b> Cut in very small squares
one ounce of raw ham and an onion, which put in

longer, make a paste as for beefsteak pie (<a href="#Art_197">Art. 197</a>),
line a deep dish with it, in which put your chicken,
covering it on top with a round of paste the size of
your dish, brush over it some beaten egg, and send
to the oven, until well colored. Instead of celery,
you may add some chopped mushrooms and truffles,
and, instead of the pork, some small pieces of cooked
ham, and hard-boiled eggs cut in slices.</p>

<p><a id="Art_283">283</a>. <b>Chicken Croquettes.</b> Chop and pound
fine in a mortar a pound of chicken from which you
have removed all skin and sinews; also chop fine
about ten mushrooms, which mix with your chicken,
and add half a pint of Allemande sauce (<a href="#Art_81">Art. 81</a>)
rather thick, to which you have added the yolks of
three eggs, mixed in two tablespoonfuls of water or
milk. Put your mixture on the ice until perfectly
cold, then form it into croquettes, which roll in
bread-crumbs. Beat up three eggs, with which
cover your croquettes; again roll in bread-crumbs.
Put some lard in a frying-pan in which, when
very hot, fry your croquettes, and, when a bright
yellow color, drain, and serve with fried parsley on
top. You may add to your mixture, before forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
into croquettes, some chopped truffles or chopped
parsley.</p>

<p><a id="Art_284">284</a>. <b>Puff Paste.</b> Put a pound of flour on a
table, make a hole in the center of the flour, in
which by degrees pour half a pint of cold water.
The water should always be added in very small
quantities at a time, and thoroughly worked into the
flour until perfectly absorbed before adding more.
When all the water has been thoroughly mixed with
the flour, work your paste out with the hands until
round. Take a pound of butter, which has been on
the ice, and which you have carefully washed. If
very hard, knead it a little with your hands, then
place it in the middle of your paste, flatten it, fold
your paste over the butter so that it forms a square,
and put it on the ice ten minutes. Then with a
rolling-pin roll out your paste (having previously
sprinkled the table with flour) about two feet long,
then fold it one third of its length, roll it once with
the rolling-pin, then take the remainder of the paste
and fold it over the two other layers, and roll the
paste two or three times, fold the paste again as before,
and put it on the ice fifteen minutes. Then
proceed as before, and put it again on the ice. Repeat
the same operation once again.</p>

<p><a id="Art_285">285</a>. <b>Pâté Brisée.</b> Put a pound of flour on a
table, make a hollow in the middle of the flour, in
which put eight ounces of butter and not quite half
a pint of water. Work this paste well, so as to be
quite smooth.</p>

<p><a id="Art_286">286</a>. <b>Bouchées de Salpicon.</b> Take half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pound of puff paste, and, after having given it six
turns, roll it out half an inch thick, cut it out in ten
rounds, with a muffin-ring or a mold for the purpose.
Mark lightly in the center of each, with the
point of a knife, a very small round. Brush them
(with a camel's-hair brush) in beaten egg, put them
on a pan, send them to a very hot oven, and watch
them carefully so that they do not color too much on
the outside before the inside is done. This paste
should rise at least two inches. When the bouchées
are thoroughly done inside, and colored bright yellow
on the outside, take them out of the oven, remove
the small rounds in the center which you have
marked out, and also enough paste from the inside
to make space for the following mixture: Put half a
pint of Spanish sauce (<a href="#Art_80">Art. 80</a>), with a glass of sherry,
in a saucepan on the fire, boil it ten minutes, then
add eight mushrooms, four chickens' livers, which you
have previously blanched in boiling water ten minutes,
the breast of a cold chicken, some cold smoked
tongue, and two truffles, all cut in small pieces.
When hot, fill your bouchées, place the small covers
on top of each, and serve. Instead of Spanish sauce,
Allemande sauce (<a href="#Art_81">Art. 81</a>) is often preferred. You
may also add four ounces of chicken farce (<a href="#Art_11">Art. 11</a>),
which form into small balls, and poach in boiling
water. Instead of chicken, you may substitute sweetbreads;
or you may fill the bouchées with oysters,
to which you have added an Allemande sauce and
some mushrooms cut in small pieces.</p>

<p><a id="Art_287">287</a>. <b>Croüstades de Salpicon.</b> Take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pâté brisée (<a href="#Art_285">Art. 285</a>), roll it out very thin, butter
ten little tin molds, which line with your paste,
prick a few holes in the bottom and fill the insides,
and send them to a hot oven until done, take them
out of the molds, brush the outsides with beaten
egg, put them back in the oven for five minutes, remove
the flour from the insides, using a small, dry
brush, so that none shall remain, and fill them with
the mixture described in the foregoing article.</p>

<p><a id="Art_288">288</a>. <b>Cromesqui of Chicken.</b> Make a mixture
as for chicken croquettes (<a href="#Art_283">Art. 283</a>), adding a little
red pepper. When cold, form it into balls, about
the size of a small egg, and wrap up each one in a very
thin piece of pork. Break three eggs in a bowl, add
six ounces of flour, mix well together, and then add
a little water, so as to make a smooth and very soft
paste, but sufficiently solid to adhere to your cromesqui.
Then mix thoroughly a teaspoonful of soda
with your paste, with which cover each cromesqui,
and fry in very hot lard. When a bright yellow,
drain, and serve plain, or with a tomato sauce (<a href="#Art_90">Art. 90</a>

<p><a id="Art_289">289</a>. <b>Timbale of Chicken.</b> Chop fine, and
then pound in a mortar half a pound of the white
meat of chicken, from which you have removed the
skin and sinews; add to the chicken, little by little,
while pounding, three sherry-glasses of <i>very</i> cold
cream, a little salt, white pepper, and the whites of
five eggs. When you have obtained a very fine,
smooth paste, press it through a sieve, and then fill
with it ten little tin molds, which you have buttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Place them in a saucepan, in which you have put the
depth of an inch of water, cover your saucepan, and
send to the oven for about ten minutes, or until the
mixture is firm enough to turn out of the molds.
Then serve with a sauce périgueux (<a href="#Art_91">Art. 91</a>), or a
sauce suprême (<a href="#Art_99">Art. 99</a>), or a sauce Allemande (<a href="#Art_81">Art. 81</a>

the flour, in which put a pinch of sugar, seven eggs,
one by one, mixing each thoroughly with the flour
before adding another, and three quarters of a pound
of butter, little by little, mixing it thoroughly with
the flour and eggs. Then see if your yeast has risen
twice its height; and if so, add it to your paste, which

paste, also the rest of your paste, with the yeast.
Fill a buttered mold a third of its height with your
paste, and send to a moderate oven for about three
quarters of an hour. Pass the point of a knife into
the baba, and if sufficiently done it will come out
dry. Then turn it out of your mold, pour over it
two liqueur-glasses of rum, sprinkle a little sugar on
top, and serve. Instead of putting the baba in a
large mold, you may put it in several very small
ones if preferred.</p>

of stiff paper, with a hole in the point, through which
press it on a pan, forming little shapes similar to
lady fingers. Send them to a gentle oven for about
twenty minutes, or until firm; let them become cold,
then make an incision in them, the length of each,
through the middle, in which place some whipped
cream, to which you have added sugar and a little
essence of coffee. Then put in a copper saucepan,
or one which is well enameled and thoroughly clean,
half a pound of sugar, with a glass of water. After
remaining on the fire a few moments, lift out a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>

may draw the sugar out in a fine thread without
breaking, you have reached the desired result. Put
it in a bowl, and add a tablespoonful of the extract
of coffee, stir until beginning to thicken, cover with
it the top of each éclair, and, when cold, serve.</p>

the moisture, mix well with your cream three ounces
of sugar and half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and fill
the inside of your pastry. You may, instead of
vanilla, flavor your cream with rum, chocolate, or
raspberry, and decorate the pastry with candied
oranges, cherries, and other candied fruits.</p>

with it, in a bowl, an ounce of sugar and a little
extract of vanilla. Place your cream on the plain
pieces of pastry, and cover with those on which you
have sprinkled the almonds.</p>

<p><a id="Art_563">563</a>. <b>Gâteau Madeleine à l'Orange.</b> Put in
a bowl half a pound of powdered sugar, the same
of flour, four eggs, the grated peel of an orange, and
mix all well together. Put half a pound of butter
near the fire, so as to make it soft without melting it
quite liquid, and add it to your other ingredients.
Butter ten little tin molds, which fill three quarters
with your mixture, and send them to a gentle oven
for about twenty minutes, or until thoroughly done, of
which you may judge by passing the point of a knife
through one, and, if it comes out dry, your cake is
sufficiently baked. Instead of the orange-peel, you
may flavor, if you wish, with vanilla, adding some
currants and citron cut in very small pieces.</p>

<p><a id="Art_564">564</a>. <b>Gâteau Genoise.</b> Put in a bowl half a
pound of sugar with half a pound of butter, heated,
so as to be a little soft. Beat up both together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
quickly with a wooden spoon for three or four minutes,
then add three eggs, one by one, mixing each
thoroughly before adding another. Then add the
yolks of three eggs, the grated peel of half a lemon;
stir all well together, adding half a pound of flour;
beat the three whites of your eggs, and add them to
the foregoing. Butter a pan, into which pour your
mixture about three quarters of an inch thick; send
it to a gentle oven for about thirty minutes, cut it
in small pieces, and ice it as for coffee éclairs (<a href="#Art_547">Art. 547</a>
).</p>

<p><a id="Art_565">565</a>. <b>Gâteau Savarin.</b> Put three ounces of
flour in a bowl, with half a cake of yeast, adding
about two sherry-glasses of lukewarm milk, so as to
form a soft paste, to which, when risen double its
height, add twelve ounces of flour, seven ounces of
butter (a little warm), a pinch of salt, an ounce of
sugar, and seven eggs. Beat up your mixture well
with a wooden spoon, and, while beating, add, one
by one, four eggs. When the mixture no longer
sticks to the bowl, you have beaten it enough; then
add to it half an ounce of citron cut in very small
pieces, and put it in rather a warm place for about
two hours. Butter a tin mold, which sprinkle with
a few chopped almonds, fill the mold one half with
your mixture, and let it rise half as much again;
then send to a moderate oven, slip the point of a
knife into the cake, and, if it comes out dry, it is sufficiently
done. Turn it out of your mold; put four
ounces of sugar, with a glass of water, in a saucepan
on the fire, boil five minutes, add a tablespoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
anisette, two tablespoonfuls of rum, and one of curaçoa,
which pour gradually over your cake until absorbed,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_566">566</a>. <b>Manquet.</b> Put the yolks of eight eggs in
a bowl with half a pound of sugar, and stir with a
wooden spoon three or four minutes; then add the
grated peel of a lemon. Whip the three whites of
your eggs until very stiff, add them gradually to the
above ingredients, also an ounce of melted butter,
and stir all together lightly. Butter a tin mold, dust
it with flour, pour into it your mixture, and send it
to a gentle oven for about half an hour. Slip the
point of a knife into your cake, and, if it comes out
dry, it is sufficiently done.</p>

<p><a id="Art_567">567</a>. <b>Sponge Cake.</b> Put in a bowl a pound of
flour, three quarters of a pound of powdered sugar,
two eggs, two glasses of milk, and the grated rind of
a lemon. Mix all well together, and then add six
ounces of melted butter, and a teaspoonful of Royal
Baking Powder. Butter a tin mold, in which pour
your mixture; send it to a gentle oven, and, when
sufficiently colored, slip the point of a knife into it,
and, if it comes out dry, your cake is done. Turn it
out of the mold, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_568">568</a>. <b>Lady Fingers.</b> Put four ounces of powdered
sugar in a bowl, with the yolks of four eggs,
and stir them well together with a wooden spoon,
until they become white and slightly consistent;
then add three ounces of flour and a little grated
lemon-peel. Beat up the whites of your eggs until
very stiff, then mix them lightly, in small quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
at a time, with your other ingredients. Pour your
mixture into a cornucopia made of stiff paper, with
a hole in the end, through which press it on a pan
(on which you have spread a sheet of white paper),
forming it into lady fingers, about five inches long
and not quite an inch wide, sprinkle each with powdered
sugar, and send them to a very gentle oven,
watching them, so that they do not color too much.
When they are firm, slip the blade of a knife underneath
them, so as to remove them from the pan, and
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_569">569</a>. <b>Savoy Cake.</b> Put the yolks of three eggs
in a bowl, with four ounces of powdered sugar, beat
them well until slightly consistent, and add to them
an ounce and a half of flour, an ounce of corn starch,
a few drops of extract of vanilla, and mix all well
together. Beat up the whites of your eggs very stiff,
and stir them lightly with your other ingredients.
Butter a mold, which sprinkle with sugar, and into
which pour your mixture. Send it to a gentle oven,
and, when it is done (of which you may judge by
slipping the point of a knife into it, and, if it comes
out dry, your cake is sufficiently baked), turn it out of
the mold, let it become cold, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_570">570</a>. <b>Macaroons.</b> Put half a pound of almonds
in boiling water, remove the skins, then put
the almonds in cold water, which drain off, and put
them in the oven to dry. Pound them to a paste,
adding, by degrees, the white of an egg; then add a
pound and a half of powdered sugar, again pound
well, adding, little by little, the whites of two eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Spread on a pan a sheet of white paper, form your
mixture in little rounds, somewhat smaller than a
twenty-five cent piece, place them on top of the
paper in your pan, each about an inch and a half
apart from the other. Send them to a gentle oven
for about twelve minutes, the door of the oven shut,
and, at the end of that time, if they are well colored,
remove them from the oven, let them become cold,
turn the paper upside down, moisten it with a little
water underneath, and remove the macaroons.</p>

<p><a id="Art_571">571</a>. <b>Tea Cakes.</b> Put on a table a pound of
flour, which you have previously sifted, make a hole
in the middle, in which place half a pound of butter,
six ounces of powdered sugar, a pinch of ginger, and
four eggs. Mix all well together, and roll out your
paste extremely thin, cut it out in rounds or squares,
which put on a pan, which you have buttered lightly,
brush your cakes with beaten egg, sprinkle them on
top with half a pound of currants. Send them to the
oven, and, when colored a bright yellow, remove
them, and serve when needed.</p>

<p><a id="Art_572">572</a>. <b>Chocolate Cakes.</b> Make the same mixture
as for Savoy cake (Art. 569), put it in a cornucopia
made of stiff paper, with a hole in the end,
through which press it on a pan (on which you have
spread a sheet of white paper), and form it into small
rounds about the size of a fifty-cent piece. Send
them to a gentle oven until they are quite firm, then
let them become cold, and cut them all the same
size with a small round cutter. Spread a layer of
peach or other marmalade on the half of your cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which cover with the other half. Melt about two
ounces of chocolate in about two tablespoonfuls of
water. Put in a saucepan on the fire half a pound
of sugar, with half a glass of water, boil for about
eight to ten minutes, lift out some of the sugar with
a spoon, drop it into cold water, place it between the
thumb and third finger, and, if you may draw the
sugar out into a long fine thread without breaking,
you have reached the desired result. Then put your
chocolate in a bowl, add your sugar, stirring until
beginning to thicken. Take as many little wooden
skewers as you have cakes, sharpen them to a fine
point, stick one into each cake, which dip into your
chocolate and sugar, covering it entirely. Put a colander
upside down on a table, and in the holes place
the ends of your sticks, thereby allowing the cakes
on the opposite end to dry, after which remove your
cakes from the sticks, and serve when needed.</p>

<p><a id="Art_573">573</a>. <b>Angel Cake.</b> Beat the whites of eleven
eggs very stiff. Mix with half a pound of sifted
flour, half a pound of sugar, and a teaspoonful of
cream of tartar. Flavor with extract of almond or
extract of pineapple. Then mix all together with
the whites of eggs, and bake in a moderate oven for
about forty minutes, or until thoroughly done, of
which you may judge by passing the point of a knife
into your cake, and, if it comes out dry, it is sufficiently
done. Do not butter the pan for this cake.</p>

<p><a id="Art_574">574</a>. <b>Pound Cake.</b> Put in a bowl half a pound
of butter, which you have put in rather a warm place,
so as to be a little soft. Add two eggs, which beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
well together with the butter for four or five minutes.
Add another egg, which also beat five minutes,
and then another, and beat all together the
same length of time, and mix with the foregoing half
a pound of flour, four ounces of currants, and the
same of raisins, which you have stoned. Butter a
mold, put a piece of paper in the bottom, and also
around the sides, pour your mixture into the mold,
and send it to a moderate oven for about an hour.
Pass the point of a knife into your cake, and, if it
comes out dry, it is sufficiently done.</p>

<p><a id="Art_575">575</a>. <b>Charlotte-Russe.</b> Butter a tin mold, the
bottom and sides of which line with lady fingers.
Whip a pint of cream until quite firm, and put it on
the ice. Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in about
a sherry-glass of hot water, then add four ounces of
sugar. Boil a sherry-glass of milk, remove it from
the fire, and mix with it four eggs, stirring rapidly.
Strain your gelatine and sugar, and add them, with
a teaspoonful of vanilla, to your other ingredients,
and mix all well together. When beginning to
stiffen, add your whipped cream, which remove from
the bowl with a skimmer, so as to drain off all moisture.
Fill your mold with the cream, put it on ice
for an hour, take it out of the mold, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_576">576</a>. <b>Bavarian Strawberry Cream.</b> Dissolve
a quarter of an ounce of gelatine in three or four
tablespoonfuls of hot water, then add to it four
ounces of powdered sugar, and put it through a
sieve. Whip a pint of cream, and, when firm, put it
on ice for a quarter of an hour. Press four ounces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of strawberries through a sieve, which put in a bowl
with your gelatine and sugar. When beginning to
stiffen slightly, add your whipped cream, which remove
from the bowl with a skimmer, so as to drain
off all moisture. Mix all well together, and pour
into a mold, which put on ice for about an hour.
Then turn your cream out of the mold, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_577">577</a>. <b>Bavarian Chocolate Cream.</b> Prepare
exactly as for the foregoing, adding two ounces of
chocolate which you have previously melted.</p>

<p><a id="Art_578">578</a>. <b>Bavarian Vanilla Cream.</b> Proceed as

of vanilla.</p>

<p><a id="Art_579">579</a>. <b>Bavarian Coffee Cream.</b> Proceed as
for Bavarian strawberry cream (Art. 576), but, instead
of strawberries, flavor with a tablespoonful of essence
of coffee.</p>

<p><a id="Art_580">580</a>. <b>Jelly of Rum.</b> Dissolve two ounces of
gelatine in a pint and a half of very hot water on the
fire, and, when melted, add ten ounces of sugar.
Beat three whites of eggs with half a glass of water,
which mix with your gelatine, stirring quickly with
an egg-beater. Then put all on the fire until boiling,
then remove to the back of the range to simmer
gently for half an hour. Strain your jelly
through a flannel until perfectly clear, and add three
sherry-glasses of rum. Pour it into a mold, which
put on the ice until sufficiently stiff to turn out.</p>

<p><a id="Art_581">581</a>. <b>Wine Jelly.</b> Proceed as for the foregoing,
adding a pint and a quarter of water (instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a pint and a half), the juice of a lemon, a very small
piece of cinnamon stick, a gill of sherry, and a
sherry-glass of brandy. Finish as the preceding.</p>

<p><a id="Art_582">582</a>. <b>Meringues.</b> Beat the whites of eight eggs
as stiff as possible, then mix with them lightly three
quarters of a pound of sugar; but do not beat them
after adding the sugar. Fill a tablespoon with your
beaten eggs, which place in oval form on a board
slightly moistened and covered with a sheet of white
paper; continue until your eggs are all used, and
place each spoonful about an inch apart from the
other. Send to a very gentle oven, with the door
shut, for about ten minutes, and, if sufficiently firm,
remove them, turn them over on a pan, which put
in a <i>very</i> gentle oven for about three quarters of an
hour; take them out, press them in the middle with
your thumb, so as to render them hollow, and, when
cold, fill them with whipped cream to which you
have added two ounces of sugar and a teaspoonful
of vanilla. When the weather is very hot, and it is
sometimes difficult to whip cream, put it in a bowl,
which place in a larger one, and surround the smaller
with cracked ice, mixed with a little rock salt.</p>

<p><a id="Art_583">583</a>. <b>Jelly of Mixed Fruits.</b> Dissolve on the
fire two ounces of gelatine in three or four tablespoonfuls
of water, add ten ounces of sugar, and,
when melted, remove from the fire. Mix the whites
of three eggs in half a glass of water, add to your
gelatine, stirring quickly with an egg-beater. Then
put all on the fire until boiling, then remove to the
back of the range to simmer gently for half an hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Strain your jelly through a flannel until perfectly
clear; pour a little of it into a mold, and, when the
jelly is sufficiently stiff, place on top of it two dozen
very red cherries from which you have removed the
stones, an ounce of white currants, the same of red,
two ounces of pineapple, and the same of raspberries,
or strawberries if in season. Pour the rest of
your jelly into the mold, which put on the ice until
sufficiently stiff to turn out of the mold.</p>

<p><a id="Art_584">584</a>. <b>French Chestnuts with Coffee Sauce.</b>
Remove the shells from three dozen French chestnuts,
boil the chestnuts five minutes in water, then
peel off the skin which covers them, put them in a
saucepan on the fire, with enough water to cover
them, and two ounces of sugar; boil them until soft,
without breaking, and drain them. Put in a saucepan
on the fire four yolks of eggs, three ounces of
sugar, a teacupful of black coffee, and half a glass of
cream. Stir until just before boiling, then strain it,
allow it to become cold, pour it over your marrons,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_585">585</a>. <b>Nougat.</b> Put half a pound of almonds in
boiling water for two or three minutes, remove the
skins, wash the almonds, and cut them each in seven
or eight long strips, then put them in the oven to dry.
Put in a copper or well-enameled saucepan, on the
fire, five ounces of powdered sugar, which be careful
to stir very gently until colored brown, then add
your almonds, which should be slightly browned and
very hot. Mix all together, rub a little oil lightly
over a pan, into which pour your nougat, cut it immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
into pieces about four inches long and an
inch and a half wide, and let them become cold.</p>

<p><a id="Art_586">586</a>. <b>Vanilla Ice Cream.</b> Put in a saucepan
on the fire a quart of milk, three quarters of a pound
of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of extract of vanilla,
and eight yolks of eggs. Stir well with an egg-beater,
and, when beginning to thicken without boiling,
strain your mixture and allow it to become cold.
Place the tin freezer into the pail belonging to it, surround
it with chopped ice mixed with about half a
pound of rock salt, pour your cream into the tin
can, which cover, and then turn the handle at the
side of the pail rapidly around for a few moments,
take off the cover from the can, and with a spoon
detach any of the cream which may have frozen
to the sides. Again put on the cover, continue to
turn the handle, repeating from time to time the
operation just described, and pressing the cream
down with the spoon, so as to make it smooth.
When the cream is thoroughly frozen, put it into
a mold, place a piece of thick paper on top, over
which shut down the cover securely. Place your
mold in a bowl, surround it with chopped ice, with
which mix two handfuls of rock salt. Just before
serving, turn your ice cream out of the mold by dipping
it for a few seconds in warm water. Instead of
extract of vanilla, the vanilla-bean will give a much
better flavor.</p>

<p><a id="Art_587">587</a>. <b>Coffee Ice Cream.</b> Put in a saucepan on
the fire a pint and a half of milk, the yolks of eight
eggs, fourteen ounces of sugar, and half a pint of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

as the foregoing.</p>

<p><a id="Art_588">588</a>. <b>Chocolate Ice Cream.</b> Prepare a mixture
as for vanilla ice cream (Art. 586). Melt four
ounces of chocolate in half a glass of water, on the
fire, add it to your mixture, strain it through a sieve,
and freeze as described in Art. 586.</p>

<p><a id="Art_589">589</a>. <b>Strawberry Ice Cream.</b> Press through
a sieve a sufficient quantity of strawberries to obtain
half a pint of juice, which put into a tin freezing-can
with three quarters of a pound of sugar and a

).</p>

<p><a id="Art_590">590</a>. <b>Strawberry Mousse.</b> Proceed as for strawberry
ice cream, and, when half frozen, stir into it
quickly a pint of whipped cream, put it in a mold for
two hours, surrounded by cracked ice and a little
rock salt, then turn it out, and serve. Whipped
cream may be added to all kinds of plain ice
creams.</p>

<p><a id="Art_591">591</a>. <b>Neapolitan Ice Cream.</b> Prepare a mixture
as for vanilla ice cream (Art. 586). Let it become
cold, put it in the freezer, and, when not quite
frozen, take out one third of it, stirring into it
rapidly about an ounce and a half of chocolate,
which you have previously melted. Put it into a
mold, which place in a large bowl, and surround
the mold with cracked ice, and about two handfuls
of rock salt. When the ice cream is sufficiently stiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to support another layer on top, take out the half of
that which is in the freezer, place it in your mold
on top of the chocolate ice cream. Then mix with
the remaining portion of ice cream not quite a gill
of strawberry juice, and place in your mold, which
leave two hours in the ice, turn the ice cream out,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_592">592</a>. <b>Nesselrode Pudding.</b> Remove the shells
from two dozen French chestnuts, which put in a
saucepan, with a little water, then peel off the skin
which covers them, and put the chestnuts in a saucepan
on the fire, with a pint of water and a pound of
sugar. Boil them until very soft, then press them
through a sieve, and put them again in a saucepan
with a pint of cream, in which you mixed the yolks
of four eggs. Just before beginning to boil, put your
mixture through a sieve, add an ounce of raisins,
which you have stoned, an ounce of currants, two
sherry-glasses of yellow chartreuse, and freeze it, as
described in Art. 586. When frozen, cut four candied
apricots, also four candied green gages, and half an
ounce of citron all in small pieces, add three ounces
of candied cherries; mix them thoroughly in your ice
cream, which put in a mold, a thick piece of paper
on top, and the cover securely shut down upon it.
Put some cracked ice, mixed with two handfuls of
rock salt, in a bowl, in the middle of which place

<p><a id="Art_593">593</a>. <b>Frozen Apple Pudding à la Marie
Héloise.</b> Cut four ounces of almonds, and the same
of citron, into long thin strips, and boil them in a
thick sugar sirup, with four ounces of large raisins,
and the same of candied cherries; when boiled, let
them become cold. Pare twenty-four large apples,
which cut in quarters, remove the core, and stew
them in a little water, then press them through a

glass of orange marmalade or quince jelly. When
cold, add the almonds, citron, cherries, and raisins,
a sherry-glass of brandy, the same of maraschino,
and put the whole into a freezer and freeze from ten
to fifteen minutes. Then stir into it rapidly a pint
of stiff whipped cream, and put into a mold, which
place in a large bowl, and surround the mold with
cracked ice mixed with about two handfuls of rock
salt. Leave it for two hours, then turn it out of the
mold on a dish, surround it with whipped cream, to
which you have added about two ounces of sugar,
and flavored with vanilla.</p>

<p><a id="Art_594">594</a>. <b>Orange Ice.</b> Put a quart of water in a
saucepan on the fire, with three quarters of a pound
of sugar, which boil ten minutes, remove from the
fire and allow it to become cold. Take the juice of
a dozen oranges and four lemons, strain, rasp a lump
of sugar with the rind of an orange, which add to
the juice, mix all together with the water and sugar,
and freeze, as described in Art. 586. Strawberry

pound of sugar, a pound and a half of pineapple,
which chop fine and pound in a mortar, press
through a sieve, and finish as the above.</p>

<p><a id="Art_596">596</a>. <b>Orange Baskets.</b> Take ten oranges, as
large as possible; with a penknife, or the point of a
small, sharp knife, form the handle of the basket, by
beginning at the side of the orange and cutting a line
across the top, stopping just opposite where you
have begun. Cut another line exactly as the first,
half an inch apart from it, then cut around the
orange in the middle, stopping at where the handle
is marked out. Remove the two quarters of peel,
pass the knife under the handle, so as to loosen the
orange, which remove as carefully as possible, and
proceed in the same manner, so as to remove most
of the orange from the basket, and the remainder
scoop out with a teaspoon. Dry the baskets with a
cloth, tie the handles with bows of narrow ribbons of
all colors, fill them with orange ice as the foregoing,

a pint of Indian meal. If thicker than the consistency
of rich boiled custard, add a little more milk.
Bake in a deep pan (so as to allow the mixture to
rise), in an oven which is quite hot at the bottom
and not too much so at the top.</p>

<p><a id="Art_602">602</a>. <b>Fairies.</b> With a pint of flour mix a scant
tablespoonful of butter, some salt, and enough water
to make a dough which may be kneaded. When
kneaded sufficiently, roll the dough out as thin as a
sheet of paper; cut it in rounds with a muffin-ring,
prick them with a fork, and bake them for an instant
in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<p><a id="Art_603">603</a>. <b>Waffles.</b> Dissolve half a pound of fresh
butter in a quart of new milk; then thoroughly mix
with the above a quart of flour; add six fresh eggs
which you have previously beaten very light, and a
little salt. Bake in waffle-irons, which should be
greased with good butter after the baking of each
waffle. Butter the waffles while very hot, before
serving, and serve with them one and a half tablespoonfuls
of powdered cinnamon, well mixed with
six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. When very
rich cream may be procured, three or four tablespoonfuls
may be added to the milk in the above receipt.</p>

<p><a id="Art_604">604</a>. <b>Gingerbread.</b> Mix well with a pint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
molasses half a pound of sugar, half a pound of butter,
and three eggs. Dissolve an ounce of baking
soda in a pint of water, which add to the above ingredients,
with also an ounce of ground ginger; then
add two pounds of flour; mix all well together, and
bake in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<p><a id="Art_605">605</a>. <b>Ginger Snaps.</b> Sift half an ounce of
baking soda through a pound and three quarters of
flour; also sift half a pound of sugar through the
flour, which then mix well with half a pound of butter;
add half an ounce of ginger, the same of ground
allspice; mix together a pint of molasses with half
a gill of water, which add to the other ingredients,
mixing all thoroughly together; roll out very thin
and bake until very crisp. When ginger snaps are
liked very hot, sometimes red pepper is added.</p>

<p><a id="Art_606">606</a>. <b>Cookies.</b> Take four ounces of butter,
three ounces of pulverized sugar, and six ounces of
flour; rub all together until in crumbs; add two
yolks of eggs, which mix thoroughly together with
the above ingredients until quite smooth. Put this
mixture on a plate, which cover with another plate,
and let it rest in a cool place for half an hour; roll
it out an eighth of an inch thick, cut it out in small
rounds a little larger than a silver dollar, and bake
in a moderate oven until colored a <i>very</i> light brown;
spread some raspberry jam on half of the rounds,
and cover with the other half.</p>

<p><a id="Art_607">607</a>. <b>Boiled Potatoes.</b> Take about twelve potatoes,
which wash well in cold water; peel them,
cutting out the eyes or any black specks which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
potatoes may have; then put them in a saucepan in
which there is enough cold water to cover them,
sprinkle them over with about a teaspoonful of salt,
and put them on the fire for about half an hour,
then pierce them with a fork, to see if they are
thoroughly done; if so, drain them, place a cloth on
top of them, cover the saucepan with its lid, and
put it at the side of the range, to steam the potatoes
until quite dry, and serve them very hot. Some
persons prefer them boiled and served with the
skins on, or boiled in their skins and peeled before
serving.</p>

<p><a id="Art_608">608</a>. <b>Boiled Rice.</b> Take three quarters of a
pound of rice, which wash well in cold water, drain
and rub the rice with your hands; pick out the yellow
grains and specks of black; then wash the rice
again three or four times, changing the water, and
rubbing it with the hands. After the last time, pour
some cold water over it, and put it in a saucepan on
the fire in which there are about five quarts of <i>boiling</i>
water. Stir with a wooden spoon, and add half a
teaspoonful of salt. Boil the rice rapidly for about
twenty minutes, skimming off at intervals the scum
which rises. When the rice is soft, drain it, and
then pour a little cold water over it, which also drain
instantly. Put the rice, without any water, into a
saucepan, which half cover, and put at the side of
the range. Stir every now and then, and, when the
rice is perfectly dry, serve.</p>
