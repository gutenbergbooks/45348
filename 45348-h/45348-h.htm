<h2>A FEW GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this volume is to present to the
public a number of attractive receipts in a form so
clear and concise as to render their execution practicable
and comparatively easy. This is a need
which we believe has long been felt; those books of
value on the subject of cookery hitherto published
generally having been written in French, and those
which have appeared in English, while perhaps containing
something of merit, usually so abound in the
use of technical terms as to harass and puzzle the
inexperienced. The general directions also are usually
of such vague and incomprehensible a character
as to render their meaning quite unintelligible to the
reader. In view of these difficulties, we have endeavored
to avoid those terms not generally understood,
and to condense each receipt as much
as possible, compatible with a clear and thorough
understanding of the subject. We have also studied
simplicity of language, so that our book may come
within the comprehension of all classes, and that
which we consider of importance, to cooks themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
We believe that we will not be met with indignant
protest in venturing to assert that cooking
as an art is greatly neglected in America, this fact
being only too frequently and universally deplored.
The wealthy who may afford a <i>chef</i>, or very experienced
cook, are vastly in the minority of those who
suffer from the incapability of cooks, and also from
the lack of knowledge on their own part, leading to
the neglect of one of the most important factors
of comfortable living. We think, however, that the
number of people of moderate income, desiring to
live well, and yet within their means, is very large;
and it is to these, as well as to the more affluent, that
we hope this book may be of use, for, while economy
is not its <i>sole</i> object, the variety of receipts for palatable
dishes which may be prepared at small cost is
very large. On the other hand, of course, there
are a great number of dishes which are obviously
expensive; but these may be distinguished at a
glance.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would remark that, as we know
the furnishings of American kitchens to be very
meager, we have forborne the mention of particular
utensils for the preparation of certain dishes. There
are, however, a few articles which are indispensable
if the best results are expected&mdash;viz., a Dutch oven,
for roasting meats, poultry, and game, <i>before</i> the fire,
and <i>not</i> in the oven of the range, which bakes instead
of roasting, and so dries up the juices of the
meats.</p>

<p>A mortar and pestle will also be required when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"pounding" is mentioned, as for chicken, meats, almonds,
etc.</p>

<p>A fine sieve is necessary for the straining of
sauces; and two flannel bags, kept scrupulously
clean, one for the purpose of straining soups and
the other for straining jellies.</p>


<h3>SOUPS AND SAUCES.</h3>

<p>It must be constantly borne in mind that soups
must be always allowed to simmer gently, and <i>never</i>
to boil fast, except where express directions are
given to that effect. Always be particular to remove
every particle of scum whenever it rises. When
stock is put away on ice to become cold for the
next day's use, remove the fat on the top with a
spoon, wipe over the top of the jelly with a cloth
dipped in hot water, and then, with a dry cloth,
wipe the jelly dry. It, however, seems to us a good
plan to keep the stock-pot always filled, the stock
simmering on the fire, so as to be at hand when
needed for the preparation of different soups and
sauces. In fact, this seems almost indispensable
where a variety of dishes is required. The same
rule in regard to slow boiling also applies to sauces.</p>


<h3>BROILING.</h3>

<p>Be careful to always grease the bars of your gridiron
before laying on it the object to be broiled.
It is better to broil on a gridiron <i>before</i> the fire than
on one which is placed on top of the range. Season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with salt and pepper while broiling, and not after the
object is taken from the fire.</p>


<h3>FRYING.</h3>

<p>Be careful that your frying-pan is very clean, as
anything adhering to the bottom of the pan is apt
to burn, and therefore spoil the object to be fried.
To fry well, the fat should always be very hot, as
its success depends entirely on this. To judge of
the proper temperature of the fat, when it becomes
quite still, dip the prongs of a fork in cold water,
and allow a few drops to fall into the fat, which,
if it crackles, is sufficiently hot. Or, drop a small
piece of bread into the fat, and if it fries instantly
a light brown, the desired result is reached. Dripping
and butter should be clarified before using, the
former in the following manner: Put the dripping
in a saucepan, on the fire, and when boiling pour it
into a bowl, into which you have previously put
half a pint of cold water. When cold, with a knife
cut around the edge and remove the cake of dripping.
Scrape off all the sediment adhering to the
bottom of the cake, which wipe dry with a clean
cloth.</p>

<p>Many persons prefer lard rather than dripping
for frying.</p>

<p>Butter is clarified in the following manner: Put
some butter in a saucepan on the fire, and when
boiling remove the scum from the top, and pour the
clear butter gently into the pan which is required
for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite indispensable to good cooking that
every dish requiring to be served hot should never
be allowed to wait in the kitchen, but should be
served with the greatest promptitude possible, as a
dish prepared with every imaginable care will be
sure to fail of its effect if served lukewarm or cold.
The first quality in a cook, therefore, should be
punctuality, which should be encouraged and appreciated
by the guests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small><i>SOUPS.</i></small></h2>


<p><a id="Art_1">1.</a> <b>Consomm√©, or Stock.</b> Put in a stock-pot
a roast fowl (or the carcass and remains of a
fowl), a knuckle of veal, three pounds of beef, and
three quarts of water. When the scum begins to
rise, skim carefully until it quite ceases to appear.
Then add a carrot, a turnip, an onion, a leek, two
cloves, a little celery, and a little salt. Simmer very
gently four hours. Remove every particle of grease,
and strain through a flannel kept for the purpose.
This soup is the foundation of most soups and
sauces. To clarify: when necessary that the soup
should be very clear, clarify it in the following manner:
Put in a saucepan a pound of chopped raw
beef (off the round is preferable), which mix with an
egg and two glasses of water, and pour into your consomm√©.
Simmer very gently for an hour, and strain.</p>

<p><a id="Art_2">2</a>. <b>Bouillon, or Beef Broth.</b> Put into a stock-pot
three pounds of a shin of beef, one pound of
a knuckle of veal, and three quarts of water, and
simmer gently. As soon as the scum begins to
rise, skim carefully until it quite ceases to appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Then add salt, two carrots, the same of onions, leeks,
turnips, and a little celery. Simmer gently four
hours, strain, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_3">3</a>. <b>Bouillon Maigre.</b> Take six medium-sized
carrots, as many turnips, a bunch of celery, and two
leeks. Boil them in water for a few moments, drain,
put them in cold water for a moment, after which
put them into three quarts of water, adding two
cloves, and boil gently three hours. Add a little
salt, put through a sieve, heat again on the fire, and
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_4">4</a>. <b>Bouillon Maigre of Fish.</b> Put into three
quarts of water two pounds of black bass, two pounds
of pike, and one pound of eels. Add to these two
onions, two carrots, one head of celery, two cloves,
and a little salt. Simmer gently for two hours, and
strain. This bouillon is used as a foundation for all
soups and sauces composed of fish.</p>

<p><a id="Art_5">5</a>. <b>Pot-au-Feu.</b> Put into a saucepan three
quarts of water, two pounds of beef cut in slices, a
fowl partially roasted, a knuckle of veal, and a little
salt. Simmer gently, and as soon as boiling begins,
skim carefully. Add two carrots, two turnips,
two leeks, a few branches of celery, an onion stuck
with two cloves, and boil four hours. Drain your
vegetables carefully, remove every particle of grease
from your soup, strain, pour it over your vegetables,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_6">6</a>. <b>Soup √† la Julienne</b> (Vegetable Soup). Divide
two medium-sized carrots in two, then cut into
very thin slices of about an inch long; take the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
quantity of turnips, leeks, onions, and a few pieces
of celery, all cut into thin slices, and put them into
a saucepan, with a piece of good butter, on a gentle
fire, stir softly until the vegetables begin to color
slightly, add three pints of consomm√© (or stock,
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and boil gently one hour. Ten minutes
before serving put in three or four leaves of lettuce,
the same of sorrel, and a little chervil chopped up,
boil a little longer, adding a pinch of sugar, and a
tablespoonful of green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_7">7</a>. <b>Soup √† la Printani√®re.</b> This soup is made
exactly as the foregoing, except with the addition of
asparagus-tops to the other vegetables, which, instead
of being in slices, are cut out in fancy shapes with a
vegetable-cutter, which may be procured at any hardware-shop.</p>

<p><a id="Art_8">8</a>. <b>Soup √† la Brunoise.</b> Cut into square
pieces, as small as possible, a carrot, a turnip, an
onion, a leek, and a few pieces of celery. Stew
gently in a saucepan with a little butter, stir softly
until beginning to color lightly, drain, and put into
three pints of consomm√© (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), which boil
gently for an hour, skim off the grease carefully,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_9">9</a>. <b>Soup √† la Paysanne.</b> Take two tablespoonfuls
of white beans, the same of green peas.
Cut in slices a carrot, a little celery, a turnip, a leek,
a cucumber, and a few string-beans; add a dozen
little onions and a pinch of sugar. Put these into
three pints of consomm√© (or stock), which boil
gently an hour. Before serving you may add a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
pieces of bread cut in small squares and fried in
butter.</p>

<p><a id="Art_10">10</a>. <b>Soup with (farcied) Lettuce.</b> Boil ten
moderate-sized lettuce, then dip them in cold water,
drain and press the water from them. Separate
them in two, season with a little pepper and salt,
then lay a tablespoonful of farce on the half of one
lettuce, and cover with the other half. Wrap up
each lettuce with a piece of <i>very thin</i> larding pork,
place them carefully in a saucepan containing half
a pint of consomm√© (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and a few
branches of parsley, inclosing a clove of garlic, three
pepper-corns, three cloves, and tie all together. After
boiling gently an hour, drain the lettuce, remove
the larding pork, the parsley, and its seasoning.
Have boiling three pints of consomm√© (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), into
which place your lettuce, and serve. It would be
well to tie the larding pork around the lettuce, so
that the farce should not escape.</p>

<p><a id="Art_11">11</a>. <b>Farce.</b> Place in a saucepan four ounces
of very fresh bread-crumbs and a cup of consomm√©
(or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>). Simmer gently for ten minutes,
at the end of which time stir constantly with a wooden
spoon, and boil for ten minutes longer, so as to
form a soft paste. This done, put it on a plate to cool.
Take four ounces of the breast of a chicken, from
which remove the skin and sinews, and pound extremely
fine. Add to this your bread-crumbs, in
quantity about three quarters as much as you have
of chicken, and pound together until well mixed;
season with a little salt and white pepper, a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
nutmeg, and a piece of butter. Then pound
again, adding by degrees two eggs, until you have
obtained a fine, smooth paste. This mixture is
used for all farces of chicken. Veal, fish, and game
are treated in the same manner. Quenelles are also
made of this mixture, by forming it into small balls,
and poaching them in boiling water for two minutes.</p>

<p><a id="Art_12">12</a>. <b>Sorrel Soup</b> (clear). Wash a good handful
of sorrel, which chop up together with a lettuce and
a teaspoonful of chopped chervil, and put in a saucepan
with half an ounce of butter. When beginning
to color lightly, add three pints of consomm√© (or
stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and boil gently twenty minutes. Add
a pinch of sugar, and skim the grease carefully from
your soup. Serve with small squares of bread fried
in butter a light brown.</p>

<p><a id="Art_13">13</a>. <b>Cucumber Soup with Green Peas.</b> Cut
two cucumbers in small pieces, and, adding a pinch
of sugar, cook in a little stock for about half an
hour, then add a pint of green peas, previously
boiled, and serve in three pints of consomm√© (or
stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Art_14">14</a>. <b>Soup √† la Pluche de Cerfeuil</b> (Chervil
Soup). Fry in butter pieces of bread cut in small
squares, after which drain them. Pick and clean a
handful of chervil, and, taking only the ends of the
leaves, serve, together with bread, in three pints of
consomm√©.</p>

<p><a id="Art_15">15</a>. <b>Potage aux Pointes d'Asperges</b> (Asparagus
Soup). Take from two bunches of asparagus
only the small green ends, wash them, and then put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
them in a saucepan in boiling water with a little salt,
and a very little soda, so as to make them very green.
Then, having thoroughly boiled them, put them for
a moment in cold water, drain, and serve them in
three pints of consomm√© (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and add small
squares of bread fried in butter.</p>

<p><a id="Art_16">16</a>. <b>Cro√ªtes au Pot.</b> Cut a carrot, a turnip, and
a few pieces of celery in small pieces, blanch them
in hot water, drain them, and boil with three pints
of consomm√© (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>); take four French
rolls, which divide in two, taking out all the soft part,
and butter the inside. Put them in the oven, and,
as soon as they become browned, serve them in your
consomm√©, with the addition of a tablespoonful of
green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_17">17</a>. <b>Consomm√© with Poached Eggs.</b> Put
in a saucepan with some boiling water a tablespoonful
of vinegar and a pinch of salt, in which poach
eight eggs. Then take them out and put them in
cold water, so as to pare the whites perfectly round,
lay them again in hot water for a moment, and serve
in three pints consomm√© (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Art_18">18</a>. <b>Consomm√© Royal.</b> Break into a bowl two
eggs, with which mix thoroughly half a glass of milk.
Butter a little saucepan, into which strain your eggs
and milk. Then put your saucepan into a flat pan,
which you have half filled with boiling water, and
place in a moderate oven for about thirty minutes.
Take it out to cool, and when cold, cut in little
squares, and serve in three pints of consomm√© (see
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>). If desired, add a handful of green peas, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
few thin slices of carrots, a few string-beans cut in
diamond-shapes, or a few green ends of asparagus,
all previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_19">19</a>. <b>Soup √† la Princesse.</b> Boil a fowl in a
little stock for two hours. Take it out and let it become
cold. Boil two tablespoonfuls of barley, which
afterward put in cold water for a moment. Also
boil about a handful of green peas. Cut the chicken
into small pieces, after having carefully removed all
skin, and put into three pints of consomm√© (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>
), together with the barley and peas, boil for five
minutes and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_20">20</a>. <b>Beef Soup.</b> Boil two ounces of barley with
a little salt for ten minutes, then put in cold water
for a moment, cut into small squares four ounces
of cold beef, which, with the barley, and about an
eighth of a can of tomatoes, boil for ten minutes
in three pints of consomm√© (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_21">21</a>. <b>Vermicelli Soup.</b> Take four ounces of
vermicelli, which boil in hot water for twenty minutes,
then put in cold water for a moment and drain.
Put three pints of consomm√© (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) in a saucepan,
and, as soon as it begins to boil, pour in the vermicelli;
boil for ten minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_22">22</a>. <b>Vermicelli Soup with Green Peas.</b> Prepare
as the foregoing, and just before serving add
eight tablespoonfuls of green peas previously boiled.</p>

<p><a id="Art_23">23</a>. <b>Farina Soup.</b> Add to three pints of boiling
consomm√© (or stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) two ounces of farina
by degrees, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so as to prevent thickening into lumps, and, after
boiling gently twenty minutes, serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_24">24</a>. <b>Arrowroot Soup.</b> Put in a saucepan four
teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, which moisten with a little
cold stock, so as to form a smooth paste; then add
to it three pints of hot stock, taking care to stir with
a spoon from time to time, so as not to stick to the
saucepan, and, after boiling gently twenty minutes,
serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_25">25</a>. <b>Soup with Italian Paste.</b> Take four
ounces of Italian paste and blanch in boiling water
with a little salt for twenty minutes. Drain, and
put in three pints of consomm√© (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), boil for
ten minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_26">26</a>. <b>Sago Soup.</b> Take two ounces of sago,
which boil gently in three pints of consomm√© (see
<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) for thirty minutes, taking care to stir constantly
with a spoon; serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_27">27</a>. <b>Tapioca Soup.</b> Put in three pints of
consomm√© (<a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) four ounces of tapioca, which
stir constantly; boil for forty minutes, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_28">28</a>. <b>Potage de Nouilles</b> (Noodle Soup). Take
four ounces of flour, very little salt, and two yolks
of eggs, with which make a tolerably firm paste.
Roll it out very thin, taking care to sprinkle some
flour on the table, so that the paste does not stick.
Fold it in two; cut it in very thin slices of about an
inch long, and blanch them in boiling water ten minutes;
after which put in cold water for a moment,
drain, and serve in three pints of boiling consomm√©
(see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Art_29">29</a>. <b>Soup with Rice.</b> Take four ounces of rice,
which wash well, then boil for ten minutes, and put
in cold water for a moment. Boil the rice in three
pints of consomm√© (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) for forty minutes;
skim and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_30">30</a>. <b>Rice Soup √† la Cr√©ole.</b> Take six ounces
of rice, which prepare as the foregoing, and ten minutes
before serving add about an eighth of a can of
tomatoes, and a little cayenne pepper; boil for a
moment, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_31">31</a>. <b>Chicken Consomm√©.</b> Take a chicken,
cut it in pieces and put in a saucepan with two
quarts of water, and let it simmer gently until the
scum begins to rise, skim until every particle is removed;
then add salt, a carrot, an onion, a turnip,
and a little celery. Boil gently for two hours, strain,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_32">32</a>. <b>Chicken Giblet.</b> Cut a chicken, an onion,
and a little ham, each in small pieces. Put all together,
in a saucepan, on the fire, and add half an
ounce of butter. When beginning to color slightly,
add three points of consomm√© (see <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>), and a
pinch of rice; and, after boiling three quarters of
an hour, add two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes, boil
five minutes longer, and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_33">33</a>. <b>Chicken Gumbo.</b> Cut in very small squares
one ounce of raw ham and an onion, which put in
a saucepan, with a piece of butter, and the wings of

clove of garlic, two pepper-corns, a branch of thyme,
a bay-leaf, a pinch of salt, and enough consomm√©
(stock, <a href="#Art_1">Art. 1</a>) to cover three quarters of your
chicken. When beginning to boil, send it to the

onion, and a little celery, all cut in small pieces, some
salt, a pinch of pepper, a very little nutmeg, several
branches of parsley, inclosing two bay-leaves, two
branches of thyme, three cloves, and a clove of garlic,
all tied together. Boil an hour, and skim off
the grease carefully whenever necessary. Add two
tablespoonfuls of flour with which you have thoroughly
mixed half a glass of water, boil ten minutes
longer, make a paste as for beefsteak pie (<a href="#Art_197">Art. 197</a>),
line a deep dish with it, in which put your chicken,
covering it on top with a round of paste the size of
your dish, brush over it some beaten egg, and send
to the oven, until well colored. Instead of celery,
you may add some chopped mushrooms and truffles,
and, instead of the pork, some small pieces of cooked
ham, and hard-boiled eggs cut in slices.</p>

<p><a id="Art_283">283</a>. <b>Chicken Croquettes.</b> Chop and pound
fine in a mortar a pound of chicken from which you
have removed all skin and sinews; also chop fine
about ten mushrooms, which mix with your chicken,
and add half a pint of Allemande sauce (<a href="#Art_81">Art. 81</a>)
rather thick, to which you have added the yolks of
three eggs, mixed in two tablespoonfuls of water or
milk. Put your mixture on the ice until perfectly
cold, then form it into croquettes, which roll in
bread-crumbs. Beat up three eggs, with which
cover your croquettes; again roll in bread-crumbs.
Put some lard in a frying-pan in which, when
very hot, fry your croquettes, and, when a bright
yellow color, drain, and serve with fried parsley on
top. You may add to your mixture, before forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

parsley.</p>

<p><a id="Art_284">284</a>. <b>Puff Paste.</b> Put a pound of flour on a
table, make a hole in the center of the flour, in
which by degrees pour half a pint of cold water.
The water should always be added in very small
quantities at a time, and thoroughly worked into the
flour until perfectly absorbed before adding more.
When all the water has been thoroughly mixed with
the flour, work your paste out with the hands until
round. Take a pound of butter, which has been on
the ice, and which you have carefully washed. If
very hard, knead it a little with your hands, then
place it in the middle of your paste, flatten it, fold
your paste over the butter so that it forms a square,
and put it on the ice ten minutes. Then with a
rolling-pin roll out your paste (having previously
sprinkled the table with flour) about two feet long,
then fold it one third of its length, roll it once with
the rolling-pin, then take the remainder of the paste
and fold it over the two other layers, and roll the
paste two or three times, fold the paste again as before,
and put it on the ice fifteen minutes. Then
proceed as before, and put it again on the ice. Repeat
the same operation once again.</p>

<p><a id="Art_286">286</a>. <b>Bouch√©es de Salpicon.</b> Take half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pound of puff paste, and, after having given it six
turns, roll it out half an inch thick, cut it out in ten
rounds, with a muffin-ring or a mold for the purpose.
Mark lightly in the center of each, with the
point of a knife, a very small round. Brush them
(with a camel's-hair brush) in beaten egg, put them
on a pan, send them to a very hot oven, and watch
them carefully so that they do not color too much on
the outside before the inside is done. This paste
should rise at least two inches. When the bouch√©es
are thoroughly done inside, and colored bright yellow
on the outside, take them out of the oven, remove
the small rounds in the center which you have
marked out, and also enough paste from the inside
to make space for the following mixture: Put half a
pint of Spanish sauce (<a href="#Art_80">Art. 80</a>), with a glass of sherry,
in a saucepan on the fire, boil it ten minutes, then
add eight mushrooms, four chickens' livers, which you
have previously blanched in boiling water ten minutes,
the breast of a cold chicken, some cold smoked
tongue, and two truffles, all cut in small pieces.
When hot, fill your bouch√©es, place the small covers
on top of each, and serve. Instead of Spanish sauce,
Allemande sauce (<a href="#Art_81">Art. 81</a>) is often preferred. You
may also add four ounces of chicken farce (<a href="#Art_11">Art. 11</a>),
which form into small balls, and poach in boiling
water. Instead of chicken, you may substitute sweetbreads;
or you may fill the bouch√©es with oysters,
to which you have added an Allemande sauce and
some mushrooms cut in small pieces.</p>

<p><a id="Art_287">287</a>. <b>Cro√ºstades de Salpicon.</b> Take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

ten little tin molds, which line with your paste,
prick a few holes in the bottom and fill the insides,
and send them to a hot oven until done, take them
out of the molds, brush the outsides with beaten
egg, put them back in the oven for five minutes, remove
the flour from the insides, using a small, dry
brush, so that none shall remain, and fill them with
the mixture described in the foregoing article.</p>

<p><a id="Art_288">288</a>. <b>Cromesqui of Chicken.</b> Make a mixture
as for chicken croquettes (<a href="#Art_283">Art. 283</a>), adding a little
red pepper. When cold, form it into balls, about
the size of a small egg, and wrap up each one in a very
thin piece of pork. Break three eggs in a bowl, add
six ounces of flour, mix well together, and then add
a little water, so as to make a smooth and very soft
paste, but sufficiently solid to adhere to your cromesqui.
Then mix thoroughly a teaspoonful of soda
with your paste, with which cover each cromesqui,
and fry in very hot lard. When a bright yellow,
drain, and serve plain, or with a tomato sauce (<a href="#Art_90">Art. 90</a>

meat of chicken, from which you have removed the
skin and sinews; add to the chicken, little by little,
while pounding, three sherry-glasses of <i>very</i> cold
cream, a little salt, white pepper, and the whites of
five eggs. When you have obtained a very fine,
smooth paste, press it through a sieve, and then fill
with it ten little tin molds, which you have buttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Place them in a saucepan, in which you have put the
depth of an inch of water, cover your saucepan, and

the flour, in which put a pinch of sugar, seven eggs,
one by one, mixing each thoroughly with the flour
before adding another, and three quarters of a pound
of butter, little by little, mixing it thoroughly with
the flour and eggs. Then see if your yeast has risen
twice its height; and if so, add it to your paste, which
put in a warm place eight hours; after which sprinkle
a little flour on a table, form your paste into balls of

paste, also the rest of your paste, with the yeast.
Fill a buttered mold a third of its height with your
paste, and send to a moderate oven for about three
quarters of an hour. Pass the point of a knife into
the baba, and if sufficiently done it will come out
dry. Then turn it out of your mold, pour over it
two liqueur-glasses of rum, sprinkle a little sugar on
top, and serve. Instead of putting the baba in a
large mold, you may put it in several very small

peach or other marmalade on the half of your cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which cover with the other half. Melt about two
ounces of chocolate in about two tablespoonfuls of
water. Put in a saucepan on the fire half a pound
of sugar, with half a glass of water, boil for about
eight to ten minutes, lift out some of the sugar with
a spoon, drop it into cold water, place it between the
thumb and third finger, and, if you may draw the
sugar out into a long fine thread without breaking,
you have reached the desired result. Then put your
chocolate in a bowl, add your sugar, stirring until
beginning to thicken. Take as many little wooden
skewers as you have cakes, sharpen them to a fine
point, stick one into each cake, which dip into your
chocolate and sugar, covering it entirely. Put a colander
upside down on a table, and in the holes place
the ends of your sticks, thereby allowing the cakes
on the opposite end to dry, after which remove your
cakes from the sticks, and serve when needed.</p>

pound of sugar, a pound and a half of pineapple,
which chop fine and pound in a mortar, press
through a sieve, and finish as the above.</p>

<p><a id="Art_596">596</a>. <b>Orange Baskets.</b> Take ten oranges, as
large as possible; with a penknife, or the point of a
small, sharp knife, form the handle of the basket, by
beginning at the side of the orange and cutting a line
across the top, stopping just opposite where you
have begun. Cut another line exactly as the first,
half an inch apart from it, then cut around the
orange in the middle, stopping at where the handle
is marked out. Remove the two quarters of peel,
pass the knife under the handle, so as to loosen the
orange, which remove as carefully as possible, and
proceed in the same manner, so as to remove most
of the orange from the basket, and the remainder
scoop out with a teaspoon. Dry the baskets with a
cloth, tie the handles with bows of narrow ribbons of
all colors, fill them with orange ice as the foregoing,
and serve.</p>

<p><a id="Art_597">597</a>. <b>Roman Punch.</b> Put in a saucepan on the
fire three quarters of a pound of sugar, with three
pints of water, boil ten minutes, then put aside to
become cold. Then put in a freezer, and, when
nearly frozen, stir into it rapidly a gill of rum and
the juice of four lemons.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.<br />
<small><i>A FEW AMERICAN RECEIPTS FOR BUCKWHEAT
CAKES, WAFFLES, ETC.</i></small></h2>


<p><a id="Art_598">598</a>. <b>Buckwheat Cakes.</b> Mix a cupful of
buckwheat meal in a bowl with enough water to
make the consistency of cream; add a pinch of salt
and a wineglass of yeast, and allow it to remain over
night; then bake on a very dry griddle till the cakes
are of a light brown.</p>

<p><a id="Art_599">599</a>. <b>Wheat Flannel Cakes.</b> Mix together
eight tablespoonfuls of wheat flour with a gill of
yeast, the same of fresh milk, and a little salt; put
in a covered bowl over night to rise, and in the
morning bake on a griddle, and turn the cakes on
one side and then on the other, until both are
browned. If the above mixture should become
acid, add half a teaspoonful of soda well mixed in a
little water.</p>

<p><a id="Art_600">600</a>. <b>Indian Meal Griddle Cakes.</b> Mix well
together with a pint of Indian meal a quart of milk,
a tablespoonful of butter, a little salt, and two eggs;
beat all well together and bake on a griddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Art_601">601</a>. <b>Corn Bread.</b> With two teacupfuls of hot
hominy mix a liberal tablespoonful of butter; beat
four eggs very light, and stir them into the hominy
and butter; then add gradually a pint of milk, stirring
constantly, and, when thoroughly mixed, half
a pint of Indian meal. If thicker than the consistency
of rich boiled custard, add a little more milk.
Bake in a deep pan (so as to allow the mixture to
rise), in an oven which is quite hot at the bottom
and not too much so at the top.</p>

<p><a id="Art_602">602</a>. <b>Fairies.</b> With a pint of flour mix a scant
tablespoonful of butter, some salt, and enough water
to make a dough which may be kneaded. When
kneaded sufficiently, roll the dough out as thin as a
sheet of paper; cut it in rounds with a muffin-ring,
prick them with a fork, and bake them for an instant
in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<p><a id="Art_603">603</a>. <b>Waffles.</b> Dissolve half a pound of fresh
butter in a quart of new milk; then thoroughly mix
with the above a quart of flour; add six fresh eggs
which you have previously beaten very light, and a
little salt. Bake in waffle-irons, which should be
greased with good butter after the baking of each
waffle. Butter the waffles while very hot, before
serving, and serve with them one and a half tablespoonfuls
of powdered cinnamon, well mixed with
six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. When very
rich cream may be procured, three or four tablespoonfuls
may be added to the milk in the above receipt.</p>

<p><a id="Art_604">604</a>. <b>Gingerbread.</b> Mix well with a pint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
molasses half a pound of sugar, half a pound of butter,
and three eggs. Dissolve an ounce of baking
soda in a pint of water, which add to the above ingredients,
with also an ounce of ground ginger; then
add two pounds of flour; mix all well together, and
bake in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<p><a id="Art_605">605</a>. <b>Ginger Snaps.</b> Sift half an ounce of
baking soda through a pound and three quarters of
flour; also sift half a pound of sugar through the
flour, which then mix well with half a pound of butter;
add half an ounce of ginger, the same of ground
allspice; mix together a pint of molasses with half
a gill of water, which add to the other ingredients,
mixing all thoroughly together; roll out very thin
and bake until very crisp. When ginger snaps are
liked very hot, sometimes red pepper is added.</p>

<p><a id="Art_606">606</a>. <b>Cookies.</b> Take four ounces of butter,
three ounces of pulverized sugar, and six ounces of
flour; rub all together until in crumbs; add two
yolks of eggs, which mix thoroughly together with
the above ingredients until quite smooth. Put this
mixture on a plate, which cover with another plate,
and let it rest in a cool place for half an hour; roll
it out an eighth of an inch thick, cut it out in small
rounds a little larger than a silver dollar, and bake
in a moderate oven until colored a <i>very</i> light brown;
spread some raspberry jam on half of the rounds,
and cover with the other half.</p>

<p><a id="Art_607">607</a>. <b>Boiled Potatoes.</b> Take about twelve potatoes,
which wash well in cold water; peel them,
cutting out the eyes or any black specks which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
potatoes may have; then put them in a saucepan in
which there is enough cold water to cover them,
sprinkle them over with about a teaspoonful of salt,
and put them on the fire for about half an hour,
then pierce them with a fork, to see if they are
thoroughly done; if so, drain them, place a cloth on
top of them, cover the saucepan with its lid, and
put it at the side of the range, to steam the potatoes
until quite dry, and serve them very hot. Some
persons prefer them boiled and served with the
skins on, or boiled in their skins and peeled before
serving.</p>

<p><a id="Art_608">608</a>. <b>Boiled Rice.</b> Take three quarters of a
pound of rice, which wash well in cold water, drain
and rub the rice with your hands; pick out the yellow
grains and specks of black; then wash the rice
again three or four times, changing the water, and
rubbing it with the hands. After the last time, pour
some cold water over it, and put it in a saucepan on
the fire in which there are about five quarts of <i>boiling</i>
water. Stir with a wooden spoon, and add half a
teaspoonful of salt. Boil the rice rapidly for about
twenty minutes, skimming off at intervals the scum
which rises. When the rice is soft, drain it, and
then pour a little cold water over it, which also drain
instantly. Put the rice, without any water, into a
saucepan, which half cover, and put at the side of
the range. Stir every now and then, and, when the
rice is perfectly dry, serve.</p>
